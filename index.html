        <p>I'm from Mexico, I'm 21 years old. This is the first time I create a website. I have been a member of the
            Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life.
            I really love the gospel. My favorite temple is San Diego California Temple. I served in the Honduras San
            Pedro Sula mission from 2022 to 2024.</p>
        <p>I love to play sports, even if I'm not very good at them. My favorite sport is swimming, but I also like to
            play basketball, soccer, volleyball and some others. I also like to learn new things in topics like
            technology and science.</p>
        <p>I consider myself a simple person who enjoys the little things in life. Simplicity brings me joy.
            This also makes me someone who likes to find a logical solution or explanation to things without
            overcomplicating them.</p>
        <p>I love videogames, even if I don't play much now I always keep my launchers installed whenever there is
            opportunity to play.</p>
        <p>As many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a returned missionary, my main goal is
            eternal life,
            marry in the temple and have a family forever. I also want to keep learning and improving myself in all
            aspects of my life to achieve
            my eternal potential as a child of God.</p>
